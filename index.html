<dt> Computer Building </dt>
<dd> I was always fascinated by the hardware of computers! My previous two computers have been
customized and built by me! </dd>
<dt> Exotic Cars </dt>
<dd>Since I came back from a rich neighborhood in Florida, I have been able to find
beauty in exotic cars. Nowadays I try to keep up with the designs and even go around trying to spot
nice cars in wealthy areas. </dd>
<dt> Movies </dt>
 <dd> I loved reading fiction books in elementary and grade school but eventually that drive wore out.
 I have been able to find the same joy and love of stories in movies. Eventually I notice the difference and
 find the beauty in visual stories versus books </dd>
 <p> Check out my hobbies! </p>
